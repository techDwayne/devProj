# devProj
My development projects. 
This is the story about how 
my life got flipped-turned upside down. 
And I'd like to take a minute 
Just sit right there
I'll tell about how I became the prince of a town
called Bel-Air. 

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And it yelled to the cabbie 'Yo holmes, smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there, 
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
